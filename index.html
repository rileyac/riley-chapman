        <h1>Welcome to my Personal Portfolio!</h1>
          <h2>Hello, I'm Christian Torres</h2>
          <p>
          I am currently a senior at NC State University graduating in December 2025 pursuing a B.A. in Communications. 
          I have experience supporting teams and projects in academic, retail, and community settings, where I've built strong skills in customer service, problem-solving, and collaboration. 
          I also bring creative expertise in digital media studies, audio/video production, and design, which allows me to approach communication from multiple perspectives. 
          I am passionate about continuously learning and applying my skills to positively impact organizations and society.
          </p>
